I am a first year MASc student in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. I am co-supervised by [Prof. Alison Olechowski](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/olechowski/) and [Prof. Shurui Zhou](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/zhou-s/). I previously received my BASc degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Toronto and completed my undergraduate thesis supervised by [Prof. Eric Diller](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/diller/). During my undergraduate study, I also completed a 12-month internship at PTC Inc. as an innovation engineering intern. 

My current research focuses on studying the **human-computer interaction (HCI)** with modern mechanical **computer-aided design (CAD)** tools. Specifically, I employ mixed research methods (including data mining, interviews, etc.) to uncover the user challenges of performing version control in CAD. Tailoring individual user challenges, I design, build, and test tools to improve the state-of-the-art version control capabilities in CAD with the applications of **artificial intelligence (AI)**.
